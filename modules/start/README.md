# modules

Let's start looking into how to use modules inside of Node.js.
Modules are files that expose something so that other files can use them. You can think of them as building blocks to an application.

In this exercise we'll create a module to look for files of a certain type inside of a directory.

We'll also learn about the callback pattern commonly used in Node.js.
