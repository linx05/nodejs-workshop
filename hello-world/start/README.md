# hello-world.js

## [Basic](./basic.js)

We'll start off by doing the traditional printing of "Hello World". Create a variable with your name, and print out to the console in the format: `hello world ${your name}`;

To your file through Node.js you call the `node` command passing in the file as the second parameter.

E.g. `node basic.js`

## [Advanced](./advanced.js)

Now that we've seen how to use Node.js to run our JavaScript file we can start looking into how to actually create something useful.
We'll create a HTTP server where we can pass in a [query parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) with our name and print it out in a web page.
