# fetch-dogs

We'll be taking a look at `npm` module repository and how we can use it to extend the functionality of our applications.

We'll query the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to grab a random dog image and post the URL to the dog image to the console.
We'll also learn how to use Promises, an alternative for asyncrous I/O operations to callbacks.
